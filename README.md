  ## INSTALLATION
  dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize are needed to run this correctly, 
  run an npm i to install these before creating your db and seeding it with "node seeds/index.js"
  ## USAGE
  Initialize the DB using the sql SOURCE command, seed the db using the index.js in the seeds folder, and run the server to see the items ready to go.
  ## CONTRIBUTIONS
  Big shout out to the miniproject for module 13, and my friend Annie who helped me with small bugs, I was able to do this project mostly by myself.
  ## TESTS
  Load the terminal, create the DB, seed the DB, run the server, and perform CRUD actions with Insomnia
